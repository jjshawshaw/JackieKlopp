    <p>A political scientist by training, I conduct engaged, inter-disciplinary research into politics within a humanistic and systems thinking tradition. My political economy work focuses on land, transport, urbanization and public policy reforms.  I strive to understand the interplay between power, accountability, data and technology within cities. I have authored numerous academic and popular articles on the governance around land, transport and air pollution and the politics of infrastructure with a focus on Africa, particularly Kenya. Increasingly, I am exploring the potential to leverage new technologies and policy networks to build "digital commons" and stronger collaborative governance in support of sustainable transport reforms and hence addressing climate change, air pollution and inequality.</p>
